Here's the `requirements.txt` file content:

```
tensorflow==2.4.3
absl-py==0.10.0
termcolor==1.1.0
wrapt==1.12.1
tensorflow-datasets
numpy==1.21
scipy 
matplotlib
pandas
```

**Explanation:**

* **tensorflow==2.4.3:** Specifies TensorFlow version 2.4.3 for compatibility.
* **absl-py==0.10.0, termcolor==1.1.0, wrapt==1.12.1:** These are dependencies of TensorFlow and are pinned to specific versions to ensure compatibility.
* **tensorflow-datasets:** Library for loading and preprocessing datasets for use with TensorFlow.
* **numpy==1.21:**  Numerical computing library for Python (pinned to a version known to work with TensorFlow 2.4.3).
* **scipy, matplotlib, pandas:** Additional useful libraries for scientific computing, plotting, and data analysis.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save:** Save this content as a file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory of your project.
2.  **Install:** When you run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`  in your activated conda environment, `pip` will read this file and install these specific package versions.

This ensures that anyone working on your project will have the same package versions, reducing the risk of compatibility issues.
